# cpp_simpleautoclicker

A simple autoclicker made in C++.

## Keybinds:
- Hold ~ key (w/o caps) to quit autoclicker. (anywhere)
- RBRACKET to increase CPS (inside autoclicker)
- LBRACKET to decrease CPS (inside autoclicker)
- UP ARROW to select a window NAME (not .exe) to use the autoclicker on
- DOWN ARROW to make the autoclicker work everywhere
- Type in any key, in all caps, while in console to set that as your key. (inside autoclicker)
- F1 or SEMICOLON to enable/disable human hold randomization
- - Keep in mind that this makes the CPS like a parabola. It's most accurate at 9-11 cps, but to get higher numbers, you're going to have to set it to a really high amount. This is mostly used for things such as minecraft for anticheats to not at least immediately detect that you're autoclicking.
